# Fibonachi-Sphere
Procedural Sphere Generation Using Mesh Generation And Math Inside Of Unity Engine


Uses the fibonachi sequence to interate through a value to calculate positioning of points on a sphere
I then use [text](https://github.com/DesignEngrLab/MIConvexHull) in order to convex-hull calculate a mesh from the points
Just a quick project :P
